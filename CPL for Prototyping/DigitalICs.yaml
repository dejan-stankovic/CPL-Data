description: "If you want to control lots of LEDs or want more I/O in general, shift
  registers are great. Refer to this [article at SparkFun on shift registers](https://learn.SparkFun.com/tutorials/shift-registers).\nLevel
  shifters are useful for shifting 5V to 3.3V logic and vice-versa. "

    \nBreak-out board from SparkFun is another good option. It uses a BSS138 transistor,
    which is popular for level shifting operations. \n\nTo learn more: refer to an
