  title: Arduino
  description: "Most popular development platform. The boards differ in their processing
    capability, input/output pins (GPIOs) and sizes. \nUno has 14 GPIOs, Mega has
    54 GPIOs, Yun and Micro have 20 GPIOs. \nUNO is best for most applications, use
    Mega if you want more GPIOs, Micro/Trinket for smaller size and Yun for wireless
    connectivity. \n\nLook at this [Arduino comparison chart](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Products.Compare),
    and this [article on buying Arduinos](http://www.tested.com/tech/robots/456466-know-your-arduino-guide-most-common-boards/).\nTo
    get started check out these great [video tutorials by Jeremy Blum](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA567CE235D39FA84).\nLearn
    about [interfacing Arduino with hardware](http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/InterfacingWithHardware)
    such as cameras, motion sensors, audio output etc. "
