  description: "Drive two DC motors bi-directionally with this motor driver. It can
    provide upto 2A.\nIt is great for robotic applications and can be easily interfaced
    with a microcontroller. Dipmicro board ships from Canada, but the shipping cost
    is only $3.50. \nSolarbotics board is without heat sink and is not assembled,
    SparkFun board is with heat sink and comes assembled. "
