  title: 1N4007 – High Voltage, High Current Rated Diode
  description: "1N400x series is great for high voltage and high current applications.
    1N4001 diode is rated at 50V while 1N4004 is rated at 400V. \nOther than the voltage
    ratings, all of them can be inter-changable in a schematic. But these diodes are
    slow, 1N4148 is recommended for high speed applications. \n\n"
