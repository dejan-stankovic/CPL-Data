  description: "Using with the 0.05Î© current sensing resistor, the reference voltage
    can be found using the formulae below:\nFor DRV8825, the current limit (in amps)=
    4 \\* Vref, For A4988, the current limit (in amps)= 2.5 \\* Vref. \nThis current
    limit is 1.4 times the current in each coil in full step mode.\n\nUsing the formula,
    we get Vref of 0.525V for DRV8825 for a full step current of 1.5A in each coil.\nAlso,
    we get Vref of 0.56V for A4988 for a full step current of 1A in each coil.\n\nNote:
    these parts are similar in functionality but not drop-in-compatible. They have
    very similar interface and circuit requirements, however the package and performance
    characteristics are different.  \n\n"

  description: |+
    This motor driver has the same functionallity as the L293D but is a newer chip and features MOSFET drivers. This gives it higher current capacity and lower voltage drop.
